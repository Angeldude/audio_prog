Audio Programming Book
====

This is my repository with the exercises from the Audio Programming Book
as I work through it.

I have updated with a example program that loads and reads the sample rate for a wave file. This is mostly to figure out how to compile the files on Windows command line. 

TODO: figure out how to make these files compile using an IDE. So far I've been getting all kinds of errors.
